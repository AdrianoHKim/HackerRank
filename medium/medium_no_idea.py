"""No Idea!

There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers.
You like all the integers in set
A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0.
For each i integer in the array, if i is in A, you add 1 to your happiness.
If i is in B, you add -1 to your happiness.
Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

Note: Since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements.
However, the array might contain duplicate elements.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= m <= 10^5
1 <= any integer in the input <= 10^9

Input Format
The first line contains integers n and m separated by a space.
The second line contains n integers, the elements of the array.
The third and fourth lines contain m integers, A and B, respectively.

Output Format
Output a single integer, your total happiness. """
